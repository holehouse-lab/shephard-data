    "# Generating SHEPHARD files of protein stability\n",
    "###### Last updated 2022-12-08\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL/DR\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to convert the CSV files from Tsuboyama *et al.* to SHEPHARD compliant Track files. Please make sure you understand what these data and where data quality/filtering needs to be considered before using the resulting SHEPHARD files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "[SHEPHARD](https://shephard.readthedocs.io/) is a Python-based analysis framework for working with protien annotation data. For more details, our [recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.18.508433v1) is only ~3 pages long and was written to be as accessible as possible even if you're not a computational person. The bottom line is that it provides a standard \"Pythonic\" way to interact with different types of protein annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the [Tsuboyama *et al.*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519132v3) preprint came out, we were excited to explore the data, and parsing it into SHEPHARD felt like (to us) the easiest way to jumpstart that process. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the code for generating those annotations from the raw `.csv` data from the paper. We're sharing the data here now in case it is of use to anyone else. The original data [are available here](https://zenodo.org/record/7401275), and we checked with Gabriel and Kotaro before posting this to make sure they were OK with sharing these data in an alternative format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook takes the `parse_K50_dG_Dataset1_Dataset2.csv` data from *Tsuboyama et al* (from [https://zenodo.org/record/7401275](https://zenodo.org/record/7401275))  and generates SHEPHARD-compliant track files for the following six datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `deltaG_t` (ΔG calculated from median of posteriors of K50 trypsin (kcal/mol))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `deltaG_c` (ΔG calculated from median of posteriors of K50 chymotrypsin (kcal/mol))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `deltaG` (ΔG calculated from median of posteriors of K50 trypsin + chymotrypsin (kcal/mol))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `K50T` (Median of posteriors of K50 trypsin in log10 scale (μM))\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `K50C` (Median of posteriors of K50 chymotrypsin in log10 scale (μM))\n",
    "\n",
    "And for each of these the associated confidence intervals (CI) which are calculated as top 2.5 percentile minus top 97.5 percentile to give the range of the deltaG distributions (as calculated based on the K50s).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds confusing, **please** read the paper before using the data !!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Track-file format\n",
    "The data here are large-scale mutagenesis data, whereby for many of the proteins we have deep saturation mutagenesis (i.e. each residue mutated to every other residue). To keep things simple, the SHEPHARD files reflect data from constructs where a single point mutation was made and a deltaG is assigned based on that mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SHEPHARD track files](https://shephard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shephard_file_types.html#track-files) contain at least 3 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Column 1: protein identifier\n",
    "* Column 2: track name\n",
    "* Column 3 onwards: per-amino acid scores \n",
    "\n",
    "For the SHEPHARD files here, the track names are written as `deltaG_<X>` where `<X>` is an amino acid. The deltaGs are then the values where the residue at each position is mutated to amino acid `<X>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your had a sequence that was:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >my_protein\n",
    "    MAPL...\n",
    "    \n",
    "You might have a corresponding deltaG file with the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_protein    deltaG_A    2.3    0    5.6    1.2    ... \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. for `my_protein` the ΔG reported based on the combined digestion by tyrpsin and chymotrypsin for the M1A mutation is 2.3 kcal/mol, whereas for P3A the ΔG is 5.6 kcal/mol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "This notebook could be edited to extract additional columns. To keep things easy to understand, we have avoided using any third-party libraries (pandas, numpy etc) so you can read the file parsing in pure Python. This script does require [protfasta](https://protfasta.readthedocs.io/) to write out the sequence FASTA file, although you could also write this out without protfasta should you chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You don't actually need to re-run this notebook** - we've just included it to clearly show how the Track files where generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of how the data can be used see the demo notebooks in the upper directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More details\n",
    "The files here work with [SHEPHARD](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.18.508433v1). Documentation for SHEPHARD [is available here](https://shephard.readthedocs.io/).\n",
