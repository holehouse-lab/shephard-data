### About
The SHEPHARD-data repository is a central location where data in SHEPHARD format can be easily shared. In general, our goal is to make it easy to share and update data for papers here, decoupling data and code for papers we publish. In addition, data of interest to collaborators and colleagues can be easily shared here.
